ceo nano one material corp otcpknnomf talk technology well future plan commercialization extremely grateful john lando president company making interview possible make interview much different others first time ceo one prestigious company dedicated developing new lithium cathode material north america explains nano novel lithium cathode material great value lithium production brine producer intrinsic limitation new extraction method produce lithium hydroxide lioh directly brine technology adapted advanced liion battery technology well allsolidstate lithium battery ion battery feel lithiumsulfur lithiumair far ahead future worried present time suggests lithium iron phosphate cobaltfree battery technology might way forward year come particularly stationary energy storage application interview organized five question two pertaining current state affair rest related future complemented number additional enquiry minute interview skype follows share reader complete transcript interview dan blondal ceo one innovative company lithium energy space nowadays juan carlos zuleta jcz thanks accepting invitation interview know john long time also thankful making happen dan blondal db well great meet phone john supportive line also read bunch stuff course lithium space read lot posting year nice hear voice get chance speak jcz thanks comment well start divided interview two part one pertains current state affair speak two would like talk future well ok db ok jcz prepared total five question two pertain first part interview three second one regarding first part interview like start asking something cost battery cell said previous presentation investor intel couple week ago cathode material account cost battery cell right db yes roughly jcz connection could please tell nano one intends reduce cost lithiumion battery term dollar per kwh db yes tell cathode level cell level clear jcz ok yes following question mean going ask talking cost cell whole cathode material talking cathode db correct yes make sense mathematically jcz right bit confused know start saying cathode material account sound little unreasonable reduce cost cell right db absolutely important understand cathode material portion cell cost turn portion entire battery pack nano one upstream developing technology make cathode powder raw material lithium li nickel ni manganese mn cobalt co four material going one black composite cathode material coming cathode powder one material component go battery cell costly jcz great connection would like know specific item would important cost reduction performance improvement said cost reduction going occur term cost reduction term raw material processing scale right performance improvement term technology formulation crystal structure saying presentation question would item important term cost reduction performance improvement db ok depends little bit talking part value proposition interested help understand processing point view let walk couple minute clarify bring value various part supply chain even though know developing technology assemble ni li mn co nmc cathode material process enables u use lithium carbonate lico lithium iron phosphate lfp virtually cathode material includes highnickel material required consumer electric vehicle one place differ whole industry today cathode material made today requiring lioh know command premium market largely demanddriven foreseeably premium lioh nano process enables use lico widely available obviously lower cost value mining side also consolidating lithium upgrading stream ni mn co stream iron fe phosphate po stream consolidating one chemical reaction believe lower cost production complexity overall process making cathode material thereby bringing cost improvement production operational level mix everything solution chemical reaction get element atom li ni mn co homogeneously mixed crystal structure ever get furnace material subsequently fired cooked furnace produce crystalline oxide function battery material process produce intimate mix atom require le time furnace produce pure crystal structure fewer imperfection crystal structure improves lithium ion storage importantly material longerlasting fall apart quickly charge discharge benefit come kwh point view life material pure crystal structure store energy last longer jcz term mining part equation say seems technology going benefit brine producer rather spodumene one right db correct impact brine producer first viable product going carbonate jcz right although know revolutionary technology aiming producing lioh directly brine well db yes jcz course many brine producer still quite skeptical using technology think validated enough feeling somewhere along line going change think db well think several membrane electrochemical technology work converting brine directly hydroxide however added cost driven need ev grade lithium hydroxide cathode industry currently grind mill lithium hydroxide ni mn co firing mixture furnace firing powder particle still many thousand atom wide furnace softens atom lithium start migrate mix ni mn co lioh lower melting point lico mix readily ni mn co prevents ev grade material rich nickel forming wrong structure case already lithium atom mixed atomically get furnace trying move atom really great distance require lithium source lower melting point get away carbonate subtle point electric vehicle battery need lithium hydroxide process making cathode material today requires lioh ultimately driving need chemical upgrading technology considered brine source believe capital unnecessarily deployed resource space meet demand lioh could change technology could provide pipe line lico electric vehicle mining company worth ten hundred million dollar jcz right analyst also claim capital expenditure could reduced using new technology would save solar pond extremely expensive case right db look expert lithium extraction solar pond low cost source lithium time suppose new project come cost power versus solar evaporation situated right place maybe make sense probably account net present value npv holding product pond extended period go market versus able process directly many variable salar salar chemistry vary within salar probably onesizefitsall technology replace solar pond jcz right db may practical customize installation haul power high elevation salt pan south america may work case obvious though global aggregate cost demand lithium hydroxide drive premium carbonate least production rate catch believe address gap opportunity nano one disrupt market jcz ok go second question licensing technology going work probably know time pass lithium producing country becoming interested developing valueadded lithium project many global company also interested helping one example recently launched tender purpose mind motivated company submit expression interest willing work country plan work developed country marketing strategy technology case db great question juan carlos base strategy always package license technology never said specifically whether would work developed undeveloped country would say interest lie country friendly jurisdiction regard battery course includes also includes obvious choice friendly jurisdiction top south america jurisdiction would reason look working one country favorable deal term end day discussion licensing joint venture partnership moving forward come term know broad answer open wide range opportunity jcz term licensing thing planning include training lithium producing country get used utilizing kind technology say cathode material project anywhere else would include training part right db developed pilot plant aimed larger test volume demonstrating technology scale also teach u build full scale plant scoping operating condition cost energy etc making material scale enables u put together engineering intellectual property package would include design detail operational know construction running fullscale facility patent protect producer material knowhow would call training new instruction run facility pilot built process determining commercial scale operating design parameter jcz long going take planning complete package offer interested party db fortunate pilot plant started pretty much planned shortened development cycle upcoming cathode material still put u probably early necessary element place complete package maybe month jcz okay plan term scaling mean going stay pilot stage process planning develop larger plant db depends little bit partner juan carlos joint venture involved building servicing facility jv partner would bring operational supply chain expertise partnership joint venture make sense u licensing component pure licensing play would offer engineering technology knowhow licensee building facility need protect technology need mindful site jurisdiction depend dealing jcz right term operator talking lithium battery producer right db well may typically lithium battery producer make cathode material jcz right db typically done upstream case tesla nasdaqtsla good chunk cathode material come sumitomo metal mining sumitomo make nca product provides panasonic wrap cylindrical cell tesla assembles thousand larger battery pack jcz right db many cathode producer umicore toda kogyo nichia shanshan ecopro pulead also basf otcqxbasfy johnson matthey otcpkjmplf large chemical company right getting space looking market share manufacturing advantage sort entity like working jcz great okay talk future understanding technology inscribes could called advanced lithiumion battery term improved cathode right db yes term talked crystal structure improved yes jcz know also improvement taking place anode right db yes jcz talking using silicon tin even graphene instead graphite anode material battery tworelated question one feasible think technology going near future two technology capable adapting technological advance year ahead db silicon additive graphite anode make sense graphite likely remain dominant raw material anode foreseeable future simply many cost scaleup performance issue material proposed substitute graphite one exception solid lithium anode hold great promise industry overcome safety challenge cathode material change case sometimes way lithium reacts anode impact additive cathode base cathode material need change jcz much difference term manufacturing db fact kind immune futureproof change developing manufacturing platform flexible enough make kind lithium ion cathode material quite possibly next generation cathode material agnostic battery chemistry adapt process make new sort cathode material flexible adjust trend battery space already shifted focus highnickel material instance order move evolution electric vehicle jcz ok feasible think technology future think ready prime time say next year something like db think silicon graphite anode much ready asking anode correct jcz yes db already prime time believe tesla already small portion silicon battery question much far pushed impact architecture whole battery case graphene lot talk using anode think may technology looking application cost structure scalability seem yet jcz right planning move anode technology near future db production graphitebased anode material make sense u perhaps place u make lithium titanium oxide anode material think production method already well established jcz ok great go fourth question know post lithiumion technology intensively researched developed solid state polymer ceramic electrolyte lithium sulfur lithiumair lithiumoxygen know one thing technology share common use lithium metal instead either lithium carbonate lithium hydroxide thought nano one plan face challenge perhaps feel disruptive innovation simply far ahead worry db case solid electrolyte battery could solve safety issue enable use lithium anode would still require cathode material use today ni mn co example discussion manufacturer regard highvolt spinel call cobaltfree material material enables battery operate volt range future match solid electrolyte possibly solid lithium anode lithiumair lithiumsulfur battery require kind cathode use today technology remain far threatening lithium ion really worry reality look historically back battery company battery cell producer even battery pack producer handful successful new story outside probably half billion dollar one company bring new battery chemistry full scale production furthermore barrier entry get larger lithium ion battery cost get driven jcz sulfur db pretend expert lithiumsulfur hard beat liion battery seen substantial cost reduction since production began year ago barrier unsurmountable get harder harder lithium iron phosphate penetrates market make sense jcz yeah make sense although heard lithium iron phosphate battery substituted nmc right db correct true electric vehicle range requirement specifically high need energy density range nmc fit bill lfp better suited commercial vehicle tool energy storage solution grid remember correctly nmc projected grow twice fast lfp play significant role foreseeable future still healthy future lfp advantage lithium iron phosphate get deep cycle nmc get thousand deep cycle work ok longer range ev battery average driver us fraction capacity daily basis leaf whole lot extra range reserve occasional long drive lfp suit application need range need long calendar life longevity jcz stationary us energy storage us db yeah think lfp could dominate space highvolt spinel mentioned earlier could also play key role similar characteristic regard cycling power voltage profile brings advantage could simplify power train charging chemistry offer longevity thousand cycle application energy density critical medium tends focus consumer electric vehicle attention often related material energy storage market even larger lot room lfp highvoltage spinel jcz say spinel cathode material specific cathode material talking youre talking iron phosphate db talk spinel talking highvolt spinel material limnni oxide nano processing technology particularly good making path large volume already place mn ni relatively inexpensive raw material point view eliminates cobalt predominantly manganese high capacity cobaltbased material longerlived faster charging higher voltage jcz okay brings u last question ionbased nonlithium battery sodiumion magnesiumion aluminumion research development even learned research development prof michael zimmerman tuft university privilege interview week ago go beyond previously mentioned technology although really mention specific chemistry technology nano one strategic plan face challenge db material could make well think process chemical assembly line rather assembling li ni mn co could assemble sodium na zinc zn material within capability process way agnostic flexible enough move different market trend go back premise new battery technology chemistry need overcome formidable manufacturing barrier lithiumion battery year head start agnostic well positioned make material future nano one work cuttingedge material avoid one need year development hundred million commercialize exception highvoltage spinel believe three five year firmly technology roadmaps major battery producer industrial collaboration think viable bring table manufacturing platform scale jcz general believe lithiumion battery quite time right db yes firmly believe barrier entry growing lithium ion battery cost come battery technology need big performance boost overcome low cost trajectory liion battery jcz okay great nice talking dan hopefully week okay db wonderful jcz helpful kind thank db take care juan carlos wonderful week look forward reading thought seeking alpha jcz ok great thank much seeing bye disclosure iwe position stock mentioned plan initiate position within next
